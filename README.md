## TWITTER LOGIN AND SCRAPER

This simple tool allow you to save in json format all followers/following of
a user.  
In order to do that you have to login with your credentials, but <b>NO NEED</b> to
have an API key, since this is just scraping.

#### Usage

```js
node index.js followers -u giammirove
```  
```js
node index.js following -u giammirove
```

#### Why did I write another one scraper?

Actually because the ones that I saw was outdated or it was needed an API key, and come on 
I just to see if someone follows someone else ... where's the need to get API key.  
And it was fun so why not :3
